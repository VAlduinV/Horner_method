# Horner_method
In mathematics and computer science, Horner's method .


This allows the evaluation of a polynomial of degree n with only {\displaystyle n}n multiplications and {\displaystyle n}n additions. This is optimal, since there are polynomials of degree n that cannot be evaluated with fewer arithmetic operations.

Alternatively, Horner's method also refers to a method for approximating the roots of polynomials, described by Horner in 1819. It is a variant of the Newtonâ€“Raphson method made more efficient for hand calculation by the application of Horner's rule. It was widely used until computers came into general use around 1970.
